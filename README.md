# Nemwel Vet Clinic Database

This database is of an imaginary Vet who wanted an easier way to manage his data. So far at this milestone I have been able to:
- Create the Vet store database
- Create the starter table(animals) which has information about 4 animals
- Created owners table which has 6 owners
- Created the species table which has 2 species
- Created the Visits table which is a join table for animals and vets table
- Created the specializations table hich is a join table for species and vets tables
- Write queries to aid in performing certain functionalities eg Query the db to show all the info about all animals.
- Made use of BEGIN, SAVEPOINT, ROLLBACK and COMMIT transactions which help to avoid a situation where you might accidentally delete records you can revert to the original state.
- Made use of the GROUP BY clause and aggregate functions to write complex queries to request filtered information from the database.
- Made use of Primary and Foreign key concepts to link multiple tables
- Made use os JOIN to work with multiple tables to retireve complex queries to get customixed information about a specific table


Enjoy!


## Getting Started

This repository includes files with plain SQL that can be used to recreate a database:

- Use [schema.sql](./schema.sql) to create all tables.
- Use [data.sql](./data.sql) to populate tables with sample data.
- Check [queries.sql](./queries.sql) for examples of queries that can be run on a newly created database. **Important note: this file might include queries that make changes in the database (e.g., remove records). Use them responsibly!**

## Built with

- PostgreSQL
- Linux terminal
